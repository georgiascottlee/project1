    <h2>About the invite</h2>
    <p>Every detail of our wedding has been crafted with love, and we’re especially lucky to have a talented artist in the family! All of our wedding invitations, signage, and designs were created by the bride’s little sister, Georgia. As a graphic designer, she poured her heart into making everything beautifully unique and perfectly “us.”</p>
    <p>From the first save-the-date to the final wedding-day details, Georgia’s creativity has made this celebration even more special. We are beyond grateful for her incredible work and can’t wait for you to see all the thoughtful touches she’s designed!</p>
