    <p>You're invited to the best day ever!</p>
    <p>We have an unforgettable wedding weekend planned and can’t wait to celebrate with you! The festivities begin with a Welcome Party, where we’ll kick things off with drinks, light bites, and plenty of laughter. On the big day, we’ll gather for the Wedding Ceremony, where we’ll exchange vows surrounded by our favorite people. Afterward, it’s time to celebrate at the Wedding Reception with delicious food, great music, and lots of dancing. But the fun doesn’t stop there—join us for the After Party, where we’ll keep the celebration going late into the night. To wrap up the weekend, we’ll host The Recovery, a laid-back brunch where we can reminisce about the night before and enjoy some much-needed coffee and good food. We can’t wait to share this special time with you! More details on locations and times coming soon.
