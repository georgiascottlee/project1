    <p>Our love story began with a chance meeting, a spark of connection, and a shared love of adventure. From that moment on, we knew we were meant to be together. We’ve traveled the world, laughed until we cried, and built a life filled with love, joy, and endless possibilities. </p>

    <p>Our journey to “I do” began with the most magical moment at the Four Seasons Resort in Honolulu. Surrounded by breathtaking ocean views, golden sunsets, and the sound of waves in the distance, it was the perfect setting for a once-in-a-lifetime proposal. </p>

    <p>What started as a dreamy getaway quickly became an unforgettable milestone in our love story. With the warm Hawaiian breeze and the most stunning backdrop, the question was asked, the "yes" was said, and the celebration began! It was a moment filled with love, happy tears, and pure joy—one we will cherish forever. </p>
    <p>Now, we can’t wait to continue this journey with all of you as we celebrate our wedding day!    </p>
